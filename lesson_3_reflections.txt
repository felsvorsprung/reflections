When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

E.g. when working collaboratively in a team. Also as a means of backing up work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To be able to work without being connected with the internet and to avoid pulling immature revisions.
