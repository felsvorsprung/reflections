When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

E.g. when working collaboratively in a team. Also as a means of backing up work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To be able to work without being connected with the internet and to avoid pulling immature revisions.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are cloned repositories on GitHub. Clones are local copies of remotely hosted repositories. Branches can exist in local and 
remote repositories and help to evolve code in various directions.
